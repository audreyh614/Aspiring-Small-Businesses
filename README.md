## Data
__*Source:*__ Webscraping from the corresponding website: https://ppp.pubb.org/ca/ , in addition to, creating and generating fake data for project purposes.

__*Characteristics:*__ The webscrape is data relating to loan information of small to medium-sized businesses in California that received a loan under the Payment Protection Program (PPP). The source only provides businesses that were approved for a loan greater than $150,000. Businesses approved for a loan less than $150,000 or received a loan and returned it are excluded from the data extracted from the source. For project purposes, one of the components are to assume that Chase Bank is the lender of these loans. It is assumed that a business can only apply for either a loan or a grant within a given period, not both.

## Future Improvements
If I had more time two improvements I would make are:
1) Find a way to webscrape additional information on businesses returned from the web scrape:
    - It would have been nice to have or add information to my existing owners table that related to the actual California businesses I webscraped. I could have generated fake data on my part so that I could have insights to pull from, but I also doubt those California businesses approved for those loans were actually a B.I.P.O.C owned businesses. 
3) ...
make sure to mentiom you had difficulty finding free public datasets and APIs that contained loan information for small businesses, which is why I extracted general content from the source of my webscrape.
