# Aiding Small and Medium B.I.P.O.C Businesses
*B.I.P.O.C means Black, Indigenous, People of Color*

### Project Objective
JP Morgan Chase & Co. have announced their global initiative to invest $350 million into growing underserved businesses owned by members of underrepresented communities. "More than 40% will include low-cost loans and equity investments, removing a critical financial barrier for Black, Latinx, women and other underserved entrepreneurs.” The firm intends to invest $42.5 million "to expand successful Entrepreneurs of Color Fund to more U.S. cities and introduce data-driven policy solutions to increase access to capital for historically underserved entrepreneurs".

JP Morgan has received numerous applications from interested businesses requesting to receive aid as a recipient of this initiative. You were recently hired as a Business Analyst and assigned to a team that is orchestrating the implementation of this project. The firm needs your assistance in retaining all of the information they have received from companies and would like for a data expert to translate these insights for them.
